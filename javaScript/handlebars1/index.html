<!-- Handlebars is a way to fill in the blanks on a template... 
kind of like mad libs game (a visit to the dentist). Created a string in console. 

var string = 'Thank you so very much for seeing me, Doctor. ____'
undefined
string
"Thank you so very much for seeing me, Doctor. ____"
string.replace(/_+/g, 'Lanni')
"Thank you so very much for seeing me, Doctor. Lanni"
string.replace(/_+/g, 'Heim')
"Thank you so very much for seeing me, Doctor. Heim"
var string = 'Thank you so very much for seeing me, Doctor. NAME'
undefined
string.replace('NAME', 'Everton')
"Thank you so very much for seeing me, Doctor. Everton"
var string = 'Thank you so very much for seeing me, Doctor. {name}'
undefined
string.replace('{name}', 'Everton')
"Thank you so very much for seeing me, Doctor. Everton"
var string = 'Thank you so very much for seeing me, Doctor. {{name}}'
undefined
string.replace('{{name}}', 'Everton')

var thanksTmpl = Handlebars.compile(string)
undefined

thanksTmpl({ name: 'Brad'})
"Thank you so very much for seeing me, Doctor. Brad"

thanksTmpl({ name: 'Spock'})
"Thank you so very much for seeing me, Doctor. Spock"

var string2 = 'I havae a pain in my upper {{noun}}, which is giving me a severe {{partOfBody}} ache.'
undefined
string2
"I havae a pain in my upper {{noun}}, which is giving me a severe {{partOfBody}} ache."
var string2 = 'I have a pain in my upper {{noun}}, which is giving me a severe {{partOfBody}} ache.'
undefined
string2
"I have a pain in my upper {{noun}}, which is giving me a severe {{partOfBody}} ache."
var painTmpl = Handlebars.compile(string2)
undefined

painTmpl( {noun: 'horse', partOfBody: 'neck' })
"I have a pain in my upper horse, which is giving me a severe neck ache."


var string3 = 'I think I see a {{noun}} in your uper {{noun}}'
undefined
var yourUpperTmpl = Handlebars.compile(string3)
undefined

yourUpperTmpl({ noun: 'hat', noun: 'whale'} )
"I think I see a whale in your uper whale"

You can repeat the same placeholder and repeat it as many times as needed.

var batman = 'NAN'
undefined

var batmanTmpl = Handlebars.compile(batman)
undefined

var htmlTmpl = Handlebars.compile('{{{text}}}')
undefined
htmlTmpl({ text: '<div>Hello</div>' })
"<div>Hello</div>"

The {{{ }}} allows you to include html tags

package control install handlebars.
